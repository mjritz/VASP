"The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete. The underling physical laws necessary for the mathematical thoery of a large part of physics and the whole chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble" P.A.M. Dirac 1929
